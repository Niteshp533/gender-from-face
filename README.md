Project name: Gender Detection
Description: This project uses machine learning to detect the gender of a person in a photo.
Requirements: Python 3, OpenCV, and TensorFlow
Install the required packages:
    pip install tensorflow
    pip install opencv-python
    pip install cvlib
Run the code:
    python gender_detection.py
The output will be a window with the photo and the predicted gender.
Known limitations:
    The model is not perfect and may not always be accurate.
    The model only works for faces that are facing the camera and are well-lit.

The project first uses OpenCV to detect faces in the image. Once the faces have been detected, the project uses cvlib to detect the gender of each face. The gender is then overlaid on the image.
