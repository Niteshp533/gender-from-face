# gender-from-face

Gender-from-face is the process of determining the gender of a person from their facial features. This can be done using a variety of methods, including machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis.

# Installing the required packages

To install the required packages, you can run the following commands:

pip install opencv-python
pip install cvlib
pip install tensorflow
!conda install -c conda-forge keras --yes

Note: The !conda install command is only necessary if you are using the Anaconda distribution of Python. If you are not using Anaconda, you can ignore this command.

# Limitations of the code

The code works well for images with a single face. However, it may not work as well for images with multiple faces. Additionally, the accuracy of the gender detection may depend on the quality of the image.
